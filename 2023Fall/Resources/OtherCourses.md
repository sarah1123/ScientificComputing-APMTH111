For students in any discipline that may involve numerical computations. 
Includes instruction for programming in MATLAB. 
Applications include 
- solution of linear equations (with vectors and matrices) and
- nonlinear equations (by bisection, iteration, and Newton's method),
- interpolation, and
- curve-fitting,
- difference equations,
- iterated maps,
- numerical differentiation and
- integration, and
- differential equations.

Prerequisite: MATH 0100 or its equivalent.

### notes
Math 0100 is single variable calculus (calc II).  It includes an introduction to differential equations

They had 40 class meetings (50 minutes each).  
Our course has ~25 class meetings of 75 minutes (equivalent to 37 meetings) so would have 1 week less of material.
