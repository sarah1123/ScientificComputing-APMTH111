\noindent \textbf{Skill check practice}

\item Consider the initial value problem $\left\{\begin{array}{l}
y' = -2y \\

\noindent \textbf{Skill check solution}

Answer: $5 + 0.1 \frac{1}{2}(f(-2,5) +f(-1.9,4)) = 5+0.1(-10-8)/2 = 4.1$

More steps:

Explicit trapezoid:
$w_0 = y_0$, $w_1 = w_0 + \frac{h}{2}\left(f(t_0,w_0) + f\left(t_0+h, w_0 + hf(t_0,w_0)\right)\right)$


In Euler's method, $w_0 = 5$, $w_1 = 5 + 0.1f(-2,5) = 5+0.1(-10) = 4$.

$f(-1.9,4) = -8$

For explicit trapezoid, use $w_0 + 0.1 \frac{1}{2}(f(-2,5) +f(-1.9,4)) = 5+0.1(-10-8)/2$.

\emph{Explicit trapezoid gives $4.1$ while Euler gives $4$.}

\section*{Ordinary differential equations}
\subsection*{Initial value problems (See Sauer \S 6.1}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0pt
    \item A \textbf{differential equation} is an equation that involves derivatives.
    \item Such an equation can be written in the form $g(y(t),y'(t),y''(t),...,y^{(n)}(t)) = 0$ where $y^{(k)}(t)$ is the $k$th derivative of $y$ with respect to $t$.  
    \item Similarly to the way the solution to an algebraic equation is a number that satisfies the relationship in the equation, a \textbf{solution} to a differential equation is a function, $y(t)$, such that $y(t)$ satisfies the relationship in the equation.
   
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item The \textbf{logistic model} for population is given by $\dfrac{dy}{dt} - cy(1-y) = 0$ with  $y(0) = y_0$.  What steps are involved to use substitution to show that $y(t) = 1 - \left(1-\dfrac{y_0}{1-y_0}e^{ct}\right)^{-1}$ satisfies the equation?
\vspace{1in}
\item Consider the differential equation $y'' + 3y'(t) - y = 0$.  What is the order of this equation?
\vspace{1cm}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0pt
     \item The \textbf{order} of the differential equation is the highest derivative that appears in the equation.
    \item For a first order differential equation, an \textbf{initial value problem} (IVP) is of the form \[\displaystyle\left\{\begin{array}{l}\dfrac{dy}{dt} = f(t,y) \\
    \\
y(a) = y_a \\ \text{for } t \in [a,b] \end{array}\right.\] 
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item For a slope field of $dy/dx = f(x,y)$, a short line segment with slope $f(x,y)$ is drawn at a selection of points $(x,y)$.
\begin{parts}
\item When will the slope be the same at every point on a vertical line?  When will it be the same at every point on a horizontal line?
\vspace{0.5in}
\item The slope $dy/dx$ will be tangent to a solution curve $y(x)$ at every point on the curve.  Use this fact about tangents to sketch a solution curve that starts at $y(-2) = 1$ for each of the slope fields below.
\end{parts}

\end{enumerate}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Euler's method} is a method for approximating a solution to an initial value problem, $dy/dt = f(t,y), y(a) = y_a$.
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0pt
    \item Choose a grid of $t$ values, $t_0 < t_1 < ... < t_n$ with equal step size $h$.
    \item Set $w_0 = y_0$.  Let $w_{k+1} = w_k + hf(t_k,w_k)$.  Treat $w_k$ as an approximation to $y(t_k)$.
    \item There is one function evaluation on the right hand side in this method so this is a one \textbf{stage} method.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item Let $dy/dt = cy$, $y(0) = y_0$, and $t\in[0,1]$.
\begin{parts}

\item Find an expression for $w_1$ in terms of $y_0, c, h$, and then an expression for $w_k$ in terms of $y_0, c, h$ to find the approximation by Euler's method.
\vspace{1in}

\item For this differential equation we are able to find an exact solution.  Substitute into $dy/dt - cy$ to show that $y(t) = y_0e^{ct}$ is an exact solution to this IVP.
\vspace{1in}

\end{parts}
Fix $t$ and use $n$ steps, so that $h = t/n$.  You should find that $w_n = y_0(1+ct/n)^n$.  In the limit as $n\rightarrow\infty$ this is $y_0e^{ct}$, so Euler's method converges to the correct value.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{tcolorbox}
The \textbf{local truncation error} is the error that accumulates in a single step of the method.
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0pt
    \item You start at $w_k$.  Let $z(t)$ be the exact solution to $dy/dt = f(t,y)$, $y(t_k) = w_k$.
    
    \emph{We will reserve the name $y(t)$ for the solution to $dy/dt = f(t,y)$, $y(t_0) = y_0$}
    \item Running a single step of the numerical method gives $w_{k+1}$ instead of $z(t_{k+1})$, so the local truncation error is $e_{k+1} = \vert w_{k+1} - z(t_{k+1}\vert$.
    \item Local truncation error is the error from applying a fixed value for $dy/dt$ over a finite interval.
\end{itemize}
The \textbf{global truncation error} is the error accumulated over multiple steps.
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0pt
    \item After the first step your initial $w_k$ is not actually $y(t_k)$ but is just an approximation.
    \item The slope used in a single step of the method is calculated based on $w_k$ because $y(t_k)$ is not known.  This creates additional error beyond the accumulation of local truncation.
    \item $g_i = \vert w_k - y(t_k)\vert$ is the global truncation error.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\includegraphics[]{img/C18Euler.png}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
    \item Examine the error plots above for a solution to an initial value problem.
    \begin{parts}
    \item Estimate $h$.
    \item How do the lines labeled 'local' show local truncation error?  How does the curve labeled 'global' show global truncation error?
    \vspace{1cm}
    \end{parts}
\item Find the local truncation error for Euler's method using Taylor expansion.
\begin{parts}
\item Assume $w_k$ is the exact value of $y(t_k)$. Taylor expand $y(t_{k+1}) = y(t_k+h)$ to first order about $y(t_k)$, and then include the remainder term (2nd order).
\vspace{1in}
\item Euler's method sets $w_{k+1} = w_k + hf(t_k,w_k)$.  Find $\vert w_{k+1} - y(t_{k+1})\vert$ to find the local truncation error.  \emph{It you have Taylor expanded correctly, it should be set by the remainder term.}
\vspace{1cm}
\end{parts}
For $M$ an upper bound on $y''$ on $[a,b]$ the local truncation error satisfies $e_k \leq Mh^2/2$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{tcolorbox}
If local truncation error is given by $e_k \leq Ch^{n+1}$ then global truncation error is $\mathcal{O}(h^n)$ and the method is said to be order $n$.  For details see Sauer \S 6.1.2 and \S 6.2.1.

\emph{Think of global truncation error as being approximately the sum of the local errors.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
    \item (explicit trapezoid) In Euler's method, $w_{k+1} = w_k + hf(t_k, w_k)$.
    \begin{parts}
    \item $f(t_k, w_k)$ is an estimate of the slope of the interval $[t_k, t_{k+1}]$and $f(t_{k+1}, w_{k+1})$ is a second estimate.  Write down a rule that uses the average of these for its approximation of the slope over the interval.
    \vspace{1in}
    
    \emph{This is a two stage method.  This method is called improved Euler, trapezoid method, or Heun method.}
    \item To identify the local truncation error, start by Taylor expanding $f(t_k + h, w_k+hf(t_k,w_k)$ about $(t_k, w_k)$.  It is sufficient to expand to first order (following the format below).
    
    \emph{To do a 2D Taylor expansion to first order, $f(t+h, y + \Delta) \approx f(t,y) + h\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial t}(t,y) + \Delta \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}(t,y) + \mathcal{O}(h^2)$ (for the dropped terms to be $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, I am assuming that $\Delta$ is $\mathcal{O}(h)$).}
    \vspace{1in}
    
    \item The local truncation error is $\vert y_{k+1} - w_{k+1}\vert$ (after assuming that $w_k = y_k$).  Do this subtraction to show that it is $\mathcal{O}(h^3)$.
    \vspace{1in}
    \end{parts}
    \item The global error for improved Euler will be $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ so it is said to be a second order method (while Euler is a first order method).  How can you tell the order of the methods in the plot of error below?  What happens to the error from improved Euler as step size becomes small (and why)?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}
    A method is called \textbf{explicit} if the new approximation $w_{i+1}$ can be written as an explicit formula in terms of previous $w_i, t_i, h$.  \emph{Otherwise a method is called \textbf{implicit}.}
\end{tcolorbox}
\includegraphics[]{img/C18error.png}
\subsection*{Systems of first order equations}
\begin{tcolorbox}
The two methods we have encountered so far work for initial value problems, which involve first order differential equations.

A second order differential equation can be turned into a \textbf{system} of two first order differential equations (and an $n$th order differential equation into  a system of $n$ first order equations).
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item Convert the second-order differential equation $y'' = a(y')^2 +yy' - \cos t$ to a system of two first order equations.
\begin{parts}
\item Set $y_1 = y$ and define the new variable $y_2 = y'$.  Rewrite the equation above, by replacing $y''$ with $y_2'$.  Replace $y'$ with $y_2$.  Replace $y$ with $y_1$.
\vspace{1cm}
\item Write down your system.  $y_1' = y_2$ is the first equation in the system.  $y_2' = ??$ is the second equation.
\vspace{1.5cm}
\end{parts}
\item Apply one step of Euler's method to initial value problem \[\left\{\begin{array}{l}
y_1' = y_2 - y_1^2 \\
y_2' = y_1 -ty_2^3 \\
y_1(1) = 0 \\
y_2(1) = 3 \end{array}\right.\]
$\begin{array}{l}
w_{0,1} = 0\\
w_{0,2} = 3
\end{array}$. Set up expressions for $\begin{array}{l}
w_{1,1}\\
w_{1,2}
\end{array}$
\vspace{1in}
\end{enumerate}
