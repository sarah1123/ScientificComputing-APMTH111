\section*{Numerical differentiation}

(Sauer \S 5)

\noindent Application 1: Given a function, $f(x)$, in closed form, find the derivative of $f$ at a point $x = x_0$. 

\noindent Application 2: Given a function, $f(x)$, where the output can be found (via a computer simulation, an experiment, or otherwise), approximate $\dfrac{df}{dx}$ at a point $x = x_0$.

\noindent Application 3: Given a set of values $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, treat $y$ as the output of a function, $f(x)$, and estimate $\dfrac{df}{dx}$ at a point $x = x_0$.

\noindent\textbf{Symbolic derivatives}
\begin{tcolorbox}

(Humpherys Volume 1 Lab 8)

To take the derivatives of a function known in closed form, try symbolic differentiation.  In Python the package is \texttt{sympy}.
\begin{verbatim}
import sympy as sy
x = sy.symbols('x')
# Differentiate x^3 + x with respect to x:
sy.diff(x**3 + x, x)
\end{verbatim}

You can evaluate the output of \texttt{sy.diff} at a point $x_0$ to find a value for $f'(x_0)$.
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent\textbf{Approximating derivatives via finite differences}
\begin{tcolorbox}

(Sauer \S 5.1.1)

\[\frac{df}{dx} = \lim\limits_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\]

For $f$ twice differentiable, Taylor's theorem says
\[f(x+h) = f(x) + hf'(x) + \frac{1}{2}h^2 f''(c)\] where $x< c< x+h$.
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item Rearrange the expression above from Taylor's theorem to isolate $f'(x)$ on the left hand side.
\vspace{1in}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0pt
    \item The two point \textbf{forward difference} formula, $f'(x)\approx \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ is a first order method for approximating $f'(x)$.
    \item The two point \textbf{backward difference} formula, $f'(x)\approx \dfrac{f(x)-f(x-h)}{h}$ is also a first order method for approximating $f'(x)$.
    \item This type of method is most useful when you are able to choose the evaluation values for the function (so Application 1 or Application 2 above).
    \item When the error for a method of $\mathcal{O}(h^n)$ the method is referred to as \textbf{order} $n$.
    \item For a first order method, cutting $h$ in half should cut the error approximately in half.
    \item The error in the method found using Taylor's theorem is called \textbf{truncation error} or \textbf{discretization error}.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item The three point \textbf{centered difference} formula is given by $f'(x) \approx \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}$.  We want to find the truncation error.
\begin{parts}
\item Taylor expand $f(x+h)$ and $f(x-h)$ to second order as was done for the forward difference formula.  When you calculate $\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}$ what do you find?
\vspace{1in}

\item Find $n$ such that $f'(x) = \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h} + h^n k$ where $k$ is a constant.
\vspace{1cm}

\end{parts}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{tcolorbox}
(Sauer \S 5.1.2)

$f(x-h)$, $f(x)$, and $f(x+h)$ are nearly equal numbers.  In floating point arithmetic, subtracting nearly equal numbers can lead to roundoff error.
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item Let the floating point version of $f(x+h)$ be $\hat{f}(x+h)$.

$\hat{f}(x+h) = f(x+h) + \epsilon_1$ where $\vert \epsilon_1\vert \approx \epsilon_{\text{mach}}$.

$\hat{f}(x) = f(x) + \epsilon_2$ where $\vert \epsilon_2\vert \approx \epsilon_{\text{mach}}$.

$\hat{f}(x-h) = f(x-h) + \epsilon_3$ where $\vert \epsilon_3\vert \approx \epsilon_{\text{mach}}$.

\begin{parts}
\item Compare $\dfrac{\hat{f}(x+h) - \hat{f}(x)}{h}$ to $\dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$.  What is the maximum error due to rounding?
\vspace{1in}

\item Sum the truncation error and the rounding error to generate an error estimate for $f'(x)$ when calculated using forward differences.
\vspace{1cm}


\item Do the same for $f'(x)$ when calculated using central differences.
\vspace{1in}

\end{parts}


\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/Class11sinforward.eps}


\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item Examine the log-log plot of error shown above.
\begin{parts}
\item The error function is approximately two straight lines on the log-log plot.  Which part is dominated by truncation error and which by rounding error?
\vspace{1cm}

\item Using the grid, approximate the two slopes.
\vspace{1cm}

\item Which error function do they match?  Take the log of both sides of your error function to identify the expected slopes.
\vspace{1in}

\item Answer the same questions for the plot below.
\vspace{1in}

\end{parts}

\end{enumerate}


\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{img/Class11sincentral.eps}

\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item For each error function, find the minimum value of $h$ in terms of machine epsilon.

Compare your findings to the plots.
\vspace{1in}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Approximating a derivative from data}
\begin{tcolorbox}
(Greenbaum and Chartier \S 9.1)

Application 3: Given a set of values $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, treat $y$ as the output of a function, $f(x)$, and estimate $\dfrac{df}{dx}$ at a point $x = x_0$.
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0pt
    \item The value $y_i$ has an associated measurement error (it is not exactly $f(x_i)$.
    \item These errors will be much larger than $\epsilon_{\text{mach}}$
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item Assume the maximum measurement error is $\delta \vert f(x_i)\vert$.  Replace $\epsilon_{\text{mach}}$ in your rounding error calculation with $\delta \vert f(x_i)\vert$ to find an expression for the maximum error due to measurement error.

\vspace{1in}


%then it propagates to the derivative as $\dfrac{\delta}{h}(\vert f(x_{i+1})\vert + \vert f(x_{i})\vert)$ where $h = x_{i+1}-x_i$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}

It can be difficult (or impossible) to choose a spacing to the data that balances truncation error with measurement error.  Approximating a derivative from data using finite differences may \textbf{not} be possible.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0pt
    \item Additional option: find an interpolating function and take the derivative of that.
    \item Additional option: fit a function to the data (linear least squares or another fitting method) and take the derivative of that.
\end{itemize}

Major caveat: Two functions can have very similar values on an interval while having very different derivatives.  
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=classQ]
\item Consider the three functions plotted on the left below.  
\begin{parts}
\item What is the largest difference in $y$ that occurs between any two functions?  What is the smallest difference?
\vspace{1cm}
\item Find the derivative of each function.
\vspace{1in}
\item If the true function were $f(x) = x$, but your measurement method added high frequency noise, so that the data looked exactly like $x + 0.01\sin(100x)$, what is the maximum error you would see in the derivative?
\vspace{1cm}

\item Thinking of your derivative as your output (forward error) and your measurements as your input (backward error), create an estimate of an absolute condition number.
\vspace{1cm}
\end{parts}

\begin{tcolorbox}

Without additional information or assumptions about the structure of $f(x)$ (including information that constrains the 2nd or 3rd derivative), it may not be possible for the problem of estimating a derivative from data to be well-posed.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0pt
    \item A \textbf{well-posed problem} is one where a solution exists and is unique, and the behavior of the solution changes continuously with change in the initial conditions.  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-posed_problem}
    \item In an \textbf{ill-posed problem}, some aspect of well-posedness is violated: the solution might not exist; it might not be unique; it might change discontinuously with change in initial conditions.
    \item For a problem that is not well-posed, it may be possible to reformulate it in a way that is well posed by adding additional assumptions.  The process of reformulation is referred to as \textbf{regularization}.
\end{itemize}
