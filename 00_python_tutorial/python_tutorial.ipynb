    "## Python syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start by reviewing the fundamentals of Python syntax. Below are examples of defining variables, doing basic mathematical operations, and printing values. Unlike other programming languages like C++, Python does not require you to declare the type/class of a variable when defining it. Although most of the time, the language is smart enough to handle the conversion between a float and an int, we could run into bugs, e.g., when an int changes to a float. Therefore, when defining variables, we need to be specific about whether we want a float or an int (by adding `.` or `.0`) behind the integer number."
